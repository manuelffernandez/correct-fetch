# correct-fetch :outbox_tray:
## The goal
It is a template for querying a generic resource in any API using the [fetchAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). The idea is to have the main logic of an asynchronous request with a good error handling, that can be reused in future projects.


Comments explaining the logic are inside the code.


It's done in TypeScript and I update it regularly, so the last commit of the main branch is the latest version.


Feel free to download or fork it, and don't hesitate to write me if you have any questions or suggestions.
